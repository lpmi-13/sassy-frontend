# Sassy Frontend

This is the (current) frontend for my Totally Serious Saas Business. Originally, I started out wanted to just have something running in EKS, but it turns out it'll be easier for me to have a rando frontend in cloudfront that calls out to EKS via a load-balancer (or whatever)...so that's what I'm doing.

This site does absolutely nothing.

## local dev

npm i && npm start
